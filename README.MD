# Studio Channel


Serves as the [package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel) but hosts
a complete channel generated by the
[ChannelManager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager) for the
[SublimeTextStudio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio).

These files are automatically generated by the `Channel Manager`. So any modification to these files
will be overridden when the `Channel Manager` generates a new version of these files based on the
[SublimeTextStudio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio) `.gitmodules` file. Any new
information required to be used here need to be parsed from the `.gitmodules` by the `Sublime
Channel Manager`.

After installing this, you need to run its installer if you want to install the channel packages, or
the uninstaller, if you want to uninstall everything, after or before installing the channel
packages.

You can find they on the menu `Preferences -> Packages Settings -> Studio Channel -> Run Stable
Installation` or the `Run Uninstallation` if want to uninstall it.


## Channel Manager

This package responsible to install the channel packages, by installing the `PackagesManager` and
uninstalling `Package Control`, then installing the `Channel Manager` and calling it to install the
Channel packages.

Also, will be responsible by the removal of `SublimeTextStudio`, by calling the Channel Manager
uninstaller, then installing back `Package Control` and removing `PackagesManager`.
