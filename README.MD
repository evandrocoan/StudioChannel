Serves as the [package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel) but hosts
a complete channel generated by the
[channelmanager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager) for the
[SublimeTextStudio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio).

These files are automatically generated by the `Channel Manager`. So any modification to these files
will be overridden when the `Channel Manager` generates a new version of these files based on the
[SublimeTextStudio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio) `.gitmodules` file. Any new
information required to be used here need to be parsed from the `.gitmodules` by the `Sublime
Channel Manager`.

After installing this, you need to run its installer if you want to install the channel packages, or
the uninstaller, if you want to uninstall everything, after or before installing the channel
packages.

You can find they on the menu `Preferences -> Packages Settings -> Studio Channel -> Run Stable
Installation` or the `Run Uninstallation` if want to uninstall it.
