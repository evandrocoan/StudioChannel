# Studio Channel


Serves as the [package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel) but hosts
a complete channel generated by the
[Sublime Channel Manager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager) for the [Sublime
Text Studio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio).

This file is automatically generated based on the `Sublime Text Studio` channel manager. So any
modification to these files will be overridden when the `Sublime Channel Manager` generates a new
version of these files based on the Sublime Text Studio `.gitmodules` file. Any new information
required to be used here need to be parsed from the `.gitmodules` by the `Sublime Channel Manager`;
