# Studio Channel


Serves as the [package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel) but hosts
a complete channel generated by the
[Channel Manager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeChannelManager) for the [Sublime Text
Studio](https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio).

These files are automatically generated based on the Studio `Channel Manager`. So any modification
to these files will be overridden when the `Channel Manager` generates a new version of these files
based on the Sublime Text Studio `.gitmodules` file. Any new information required to be used here
need to be parsed from the `.gitmodules` by the `Sublime Channel Manager`.


## Channel Manager

This package responsible to install the Sublime Text Studio, by installing the `PackagesManager` and
uninstalling `Package Control`, then installing the `Channel Manager` and calling it to install the
Studio Channel packages.

Also, will be responsible by the removal of `Sublime Text Studio`, by calling the Channel Manager
uninstaller, then installing back Package Control and removing `PackagesManager`.
